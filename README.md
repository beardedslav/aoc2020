# Advent of Code 2020
This is a repo for storing my solutions to 2020 edition of the amazing Advent of Code. You can find the problem statements [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). This is probably not the best code I have written, and more often than not I abandon these scripts once I have a _working_ solution rather than focusing on building the best one.
